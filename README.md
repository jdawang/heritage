# Mapping heritage in Toronto

Which areas in Toronto are given heritage designations? What is the relation between heritage, income, visible minority status, and population growth?

Data from the Canadian census 2016 and 2021 was pulled using Tongfen, written by Jens von Bergmann.

Ward boundaries and heritage data is from Open Data Toronto.

Make sure to toggle between ward boundaries, population change and zoning layers so you're not viewing everything at once, as it will slow down the map and not allow you to click on all the popups.

As well, to ensure the heritage designation points are always on top, be sure to retoggle them.
